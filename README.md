# CAN FD[^1] demo node 1 (STM32G431KB)
Node 1. [Node 2](https://github.com/ufnalski/canfd_bus_demo_node_2_g431kb).

[^1]: CAN FD (CAN-FD) or FDCAN (FD CAN, FD-CAN)? Don't sweat the small stuff... and it's all small stuff :wink:

# Missing files?
Don't worry :slightly_smiling_face: Just hit Alt-K to generate /Drivers/CMCIS/ and /Drivers/STM32G4xx_HAL_Driver/ based on the .ioc file. After a couple of seconds your project will be ready for building.
